# Activities with AI-VIS EthiCards

We propose five flexible activities, suitable for academic or industry contexts. These activities can be tailored to specific needs and adaptable to other scenarios.


1. [Ethical Exploration and Debate](#1-Ethical-Exploration-and-Debate)
2. [Design and Development Simulation](#2-Design-and-Development-Simulation)
3. [Role-Playing and Perspective-Taking](#3-Role-Playing-and-Perspective-Taking)
4. [Scenario Development and Storytelling](#4-Scenario-Development-and-Storytelling)
5. [Learning and Application](#5-Learning-and-Application)



### 1. Ethical Exploration and Debate

Participants start by drawing Challenge Cards, each illustrating a unique ethical dilemma with associated discussion prompts. To structure their thinking, participants then select Ethical Principles Cards relevant to the challenges presented. In small groups, they use these principles to guide a focused discussion on the dilemmas. For the debate component, each group is divided into subgroups representing different perspectives or stakeholders related to the ethical issue. Subgroups are given time to prepare arguments that reflect their assigned viewpoint, based on the Ethical Principles Cards. A moderator is assigned to facilitate the debate, ensuring that each subgroup has equal opportunities to present their arguments and rebuttals. The activity concludes with a reflection session where participants discuss the different viewpoints presented, evaluate the strength of arguments, and consider how ethical principles can be applied to resolve dilemmas in practice. The goal is to synthesize a holistic understanding of the ethical issues and potential resolutions by combining different perspectives.

### 2. Design and Development Simulation

Participants are divided into small teams, each drawing from a set of AI-VIS Task Cards, Goal Cards, Challenge Cards, and Technology Cards to draft an AI4VIS project, integrating ethical considerations from the onset. They outline project goals, address challenges, and decide on technologies, weaving ethical principles and people-in-focus into their planning. Following the project's conceptualization, teams present their plans and engage in a group critique, offering and receiving feedback on the ethical integration within their designs. The session concludes with a reflective discussion, synthesizing insights on how ethical considerations can be pragmatically incorporated into real-world AI and visualization initiatives. This exercise aims to elevate participants' ethical awareness and their ability to navigate dilemmas in AI4VIS project planning.

### 3. Role-Playing and Perspective-Taking

Participants are given roles through People-In-Focus Cards, representing people involved in AI4VIS work. They are then presented with ethical scenarios via Challenge Cards. Participants engage in role-play, responding to these scenarios based on their assumed roles from the People-In-Focus Cards and using Ethical Principles Cards as a moral compass. The activity culminates in a group discussion that dissects the various perspectives and formulates potential solutions. This interactive exercise aims to deepen participants' understanding of ethical dilemmas and foster a sense of empathy by exploring the impact of AI4VIS from the standpoint of various people in focus.

### 4. Scenario Development and Storytelling

Participants combine Challenge Cards, Technology Cards, and AI-VIS Task Cards to construct a detailed scenario or story. Ethical Principles Cards are then employed to dissect and examine the ethical aspects of these scenarios. The activity unfolds as participants narrate their stories and dissect the ethical nuances, culminating in a group discussion that delves into these analyses. This method promotes engagement with ethical issues through creative storytelling, offering a richer understanding of the ethical landscape in AI4VIS contexts and its practical implications.


### 5. Learning and Application

This activity differs from other activities by focusing on the application of the Ethical Principles Card(s), which participants select as the most relevant to the identified challenge. The ensuing discussion centers on the pragmatic application of these principles, as participants deliberate on actionable solutions and strategies to navigate the ethical challenge. This process is enriched by group dialogues or feedback sessions, where insights are shared, and ethical reasoning is collaboratively refined.
It is designed to promote ethical decision-making skills that extend beyond theoretical analysis, focusing on the practical and educational aspects of ethics.
